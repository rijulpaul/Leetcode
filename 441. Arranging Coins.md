## Problem: [441. Arranging Coins](https://leetcode.com/problems/arranging-coins/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Math | Binary Search*

---

### Description:
You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.

---

### Approach:
Find the largest k such that 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k ≤ n
Which simplifies to: Find the largest k such that k * (k + 1) / 2 ≤ n
This forms a monotonic search space, so you applied binary search to efficiently find the solution.
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int arrangeCoins(int n) {
        int low = 0, high = n, mid;
        while (low <= high) {
            mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            long curr = (long)mid * (mid + 1) / 2;
            if (curr == n) {
                return mid;
            } else if (curr > n) {
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return high; // The highest 'mid' such that sum ≤ n
    }
};
```
