## Problem: [160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy

### Topics:
*Hash Table | Linked List | Two Pointers*

---

### Description:
Given the heads of two singly linked lists return the node at which they merge. If they dont merge return nullptr.

---

### Approach:
Traverse both lists with two pointers a and b.

When a pointer reaches the end, redirect it to the head of the other list.
After at most lenA + lenB steps, either:
- They meet at the intersection node, or
- Both reach nullptr if there is no intersection.
- **Time Complexity:** O(m+n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB) {
        ListNode* a = headA;
        ListNode* b = headB;

        while (a != b) {    // a==b only on the intersection, be it after m+n and n+m traversals (nullptr) or on the first common node.
            a = a ? a->next : headB;
            b = b ? b->next : headA;
        }

        return a;  // either intersection node or nullptr
    }
};
```
