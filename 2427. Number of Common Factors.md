## Problem: [2427. Number of Common Factors](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-common-factors/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Math | Enumeration | Number Theory*

---

### Description:
Given two positive integers a and b, return the number of common factors of a and b.

---

### Approach:
Instead of checking all numbers from 1 to min(a, b), I used the fact that: The number of common factors of a and b is equal to the number of divisors of gcd(a, b).
- **Time Complexity:** O(âˆšgcd(a, b))
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int commonFactors(int a, int b) {
        int g = __gcd(a, b);  // greatest common divisor
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i * i <= g; ++i) {
            if (g % i == 0) {
                count += (i * i == g) ? 1 : 2;  // count divisor pair (i, g/i)
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```
