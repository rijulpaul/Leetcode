## Problem: [ 2220. Minimum Bit Flips to Convert Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-bit-filps-to-convert-number/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Bit Manipulation*

---

### Description:
Return the number of bit flips required to convert a number x into another number y.

---

### Approach:
Used bitwise XOR:
- start ^ goal gives a number where each 1 indicates a differing bit.
- Count the number of 1s in this XOR result = number of flips needed.
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minBitFlips(int start, int goal) {
        int xored = start ^ goal;
        int count = 0;
        while (xored > 0) {
            count += (xored & 1);
            xored >>= 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```
